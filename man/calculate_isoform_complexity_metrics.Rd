\description{
This function calculates a comprehensive set of metrics to quantify
transcriptomic complexity at multiple levels: within cells, across cells,
within cell types, and across cell types. It analyses isoform diversity,
cell type specificity, and expression patterns to provide a multidimensional
characterisation of transcriptomic complexity.
}
\details{
The function calculates seven core complexity metrics:
\enumerate{
\item Intra-cellular Isoform Diversity: Measures the tendency for cells to co-express multiple
isoforms of a gene
\item Inter-cellular Isoform Diversity: Measures the overall diversity of isoforms used
across the entire cell population
\item Intra-cell type Heterogeneity: Measures the cell-to-cell variation in isoform
usage within each cell type
\item Inter-cell type Specificity: Measures how differently a gene uses its isoforms
across different cell types
\item Intra-cell type Heterogeneity Variability: Measures whether certain cell types show
particularly high cellular heterogeneity
\item Inter-cell type Difference Variability: Measures whether certain cell type pairs
show particularly significant differences in isoform usage patterns
\item Cell-type-specific Co-expression Variability: Measures whether a gene employs different
isoform co-expression patterns in different cell types
}

For each metric, a classification column is created to categorise genes based on
statistically determined thresholds. This provides a comprehensive complexity
profile for each gene across multiple dimensions.

Some metrics may contain NA values, which have specific biological meanings:
\itemize{
\item Inter-cell type metrics are NA for genes expressed in only one cell type
\item Heterogeneity metrics are NA for genes with insufficient cells per cell type
\item Diversity metrics are NA for genes with only a single expressed isoform
These NA values are properly handled during threshold determination and classification.
